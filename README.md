This is a Trello clone. It is an ultimate tool for getting things done. Whether you're managing daily to-dos, setting personal goals, or organizing your life, Trello helps you focus on what matters most and always stay on top of your game.

You can make several boards. A board will itself pick a colour from a defined set of colors via string-hash algo which is applied on the board id.
You can make your multiple lists in a board such as TODO, DOING and DONE and you can move your cards from one list to another with time by dragging the card by holding it from from the position where its title is written and drop it to another list (via dnd-kit).
You can edit or delete the card and its description by clicking on it.
Lists and Boards can be edited or deleted by clicking on the ellipsis.
